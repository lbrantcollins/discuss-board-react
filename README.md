## The typical path of a coding challenge:

#### Teacher: pose a challenge

+ post the challenge 
+ provide keywords to be used for convenience for later searches
	+ teacher can add keywords 
	+ (which will be saved for choosing again in future posts)
+ indicate which languages users will be limited to for responses
	+ teacher can add languages
	+ (which will be saved for choosing again in future posts)

#### Students: answer a challenge

+ post a code snippet
+ indicate the language used

#### Students: comment on anyone's code snippet

+ post a comment about a specific code snippet
+ edit their own comments
+ delete their own comments

#### Students: edit their own snippet

#### Students: delete their own snippet (if no comments attached)

+ cannot delete their own code snippets unless no comments have been posted

(this is not yet implemented)

#### Teacher: respond/moderate student code snippets and comments

Well, the **Teaching Assistant** will probably moderate the student's posts!

+ comment on student code snippets to help clarify/correct
+ can edit a student's code snippet to correct
+ respond to a student comment

#### Teacher: delete a posted challenge

+ likely this will be very rarely used, if ever
+ this deletes all student code snippets and related comments
+ teacher will be prompted to ask if they are absolutely sure of the delete
